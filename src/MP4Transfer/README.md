# MP4Translate.sh 

This folder is used to create a series of commands to , pull the audio from my phone, convert the .m4a to mp3, convert the .mp3 to Text using an OpenSource Language Model called "Whisper", send a message to ChatGPT, retrieve the answer and store it, and finally make it available through a server.

# Other files
The other files are just recordings and text files that are required or generated by the whole process. For example Finalfile.txt contains chatGPT's numerical answer
file.txt contains the transcribed voice recording.
